Important:
sanity-studio-cms is a React App provided by sanity

1. To run:
- 'npm run dev' to view your current schema in localhost
- After you make changes, be sure to 'npm run deploy', so your new schema is available
in sanity.io (https://gregcoman.sanity.studio/)

2. Creating new schema/fields:
- Go to /schemaTypes and create a new schema file (for ex: serviceType.js),
which defines the shape of each document stored (all fields and images)
- Make sure to add it to the array in /schemaTypes/index.js

More info:
Our CMS is sanity, to help Greg have a nice UI to edit text + images
We currently only support services, but we should add everyting so he can edit
all pages in the website

I think usually CMS is organized like:
-Home
-About
-Contact
-Pricing

But I heard that is best to not do this, and instead try our best to do something like:
- Services (includes pricing)
- ?? Photographers (for ex: {name: Greg, bio: '', about(?): '', awards: [],contact: {phone, location} images: [], mainImage: '', } )
- ?? Company ( ?? general company info )

This way its content-based instead of page-based.
For example, services info will be displayed in MANY pages (/home, /pricing, etc), 
so instead of basing our CMS on each page, we base it off the content, and /home can look
into our CMS Services for this info. If we need a page that displays additional info for
each service that we dont already store in our schema, then just add an extra field to
services schema to store the new info that this new page will display
